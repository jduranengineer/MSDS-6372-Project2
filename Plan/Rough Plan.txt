Week 2 (17th - 24th)
 - [Option 1] PCR with Basic Feature Engineering [Max]
 - [Option 1] Advanced Feature Engineering (more advanced feature engineering with domain expertise) [Nikhil]
 - [Option 2] Perform LDA/QDA/Bayesian to find grouping [Joanna]
 
Week 3 (25th - 31st)
 - [Option 1] PCR with Advanced Feature Engineering [Nikhil]
 - [Option 2] Train LM model with grouping variable (+ interactions) [Joanna]
 
Week 4 (1st - 7th)
 - Prepare Paper and Presentation [All]

PCR with intelligent feature engineering (Option 1)
 
High Cook's D clustering (Option 2)
 - We dont know ahead of time which points belong to high Cook's D unless
 - We could label the points as High Cook's D (HCD) or Low Cook's D (LCD) after running 
 the linear regression
 - Perform LDA/QDA/Logistic Regression to train model to predict the right group for a point
 - Add predicted group as feature (factor) + its interaction term (with what variables?)
 for LM model for predicting y3
 
 OR Train LM model for each group separately to predict y3 
 (but we only have 288 points for HCD group, could be increased by lowering HCD threshold)
 
 Prediction
 - incoming data point >> pass through LDA/QDA/Logistic Regression Model to predict the group
 - Use the LM model for the predicted group to predict the output variable y3
